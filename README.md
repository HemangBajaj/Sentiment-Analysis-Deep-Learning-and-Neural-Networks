# Sentiment-Analysis-Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify emotions (positive, negative, neutral) in textual data, allowing businesses to assess customer sentiment effectively.
Utilized Python along with key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Keras, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare the dataset for training.
Built and trained a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification.
Achieved validation accuracy (val_accuracy) : 0.8837, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world applications.
Visualized performance metrics and results using Matplotlib and Seaborn, creating informative plots to communicate findings.
Documented the methodology and results in a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook, available on GitHub for further reference and exploration.
